The name of the condition.\\nid: \\noperator: String. The operation applied in the condition (e.g., \\'=\\', \\'<>\\').\\nvalues: String.

TOTAL_RECHARGE_REV_LAST_WEEK - 25,30,35,40\\nif any query related to recharge amount comes use the above format.\\napart from that:\\na. P_AON (AON - age on network)  - 30,60,90,120\\nb. P_InactiveDays - 30,60,90,120\\nc. BE_BUNDLE_EXPIRY_DATE - today, tomorrow, last_week,last_month,\\nd. P_DEVICE_TYPE - mobile phone, tablet, broadband, telephone\\n\\nsimilarly, below are some of the action names:\\na. Mobile App Notification\\nb. Send SMS\\nc. EMAIL\\nd.
